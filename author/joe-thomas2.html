                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Recently, a friend from grad-school asked me about an
<a href="https://github.com/jsthomas/mgptree">experimental python data visualization tool</a>
I wrote in 2012. Since the code had rotted (to the point that it no
longer worked), and my understanding of python has changed quite a bit
since I originally wrote it, I thought this would be a good
opportunity to write about my current processes for debugging and refactoring.</p>
<h2>What's this supposed to do again?</h2>
<p>The premise of the program is pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The
   <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP)</a>
   lets us search for advisor-advisee relationships between names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to take a list of names <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and an integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and look up
   <span class="math">\(n\)</span> generations of mathematicians, starting from <span class="math">\(L\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we want to render the digraph of advisee-advisor
   relationships using the <a href="http://graphviz.org/"><code>graphviz</code></a> program
   <code>dot</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at this code it's surprising some of the things I did and
didn't know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prior to 2014, I wasn't in the habit of using virtual environments
   and <code>pip</code>. For this project, that's not really a big deal because
   there aren't a lot of dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wasn't aware of <code>pylint</code>. Today, I find that <code>pylint</code> makes it a
   lot easier to write clean python and refactor existing code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some things that haven't changed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I still think graphviz is really great. It makes plotting directed
   graphs <em>so</em> easy, and it's easy to decorate them with a lot of
   metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>argparse</code> makes it easy to write a command line interface that
   works just like other familiar unix tools. I especially like that
   adds <code>-h</code> options for displaying help, which are invaluable when
   building a more extensive CLI tool.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Phase 1: Cleaning up lint issues.</h2>
<p>Whenever I'm starting on unfamiliar python code, I like to begin with
<code>pylint</code>'s suggestions.</p>

<p>Pylint scored my original code -1.83/10. D'oh. It turns out one of the
things I wasn't following in 2012 was PEP8, which means I had a lot of
formatting/whitespace issues. Fixing these, my score rose to
6.94/10.</p>
<p>One thing that I really like about <code>pylint</code> is how it dramatically
simplifies finding unused variables in my code. Sometimes, I even use
this to help me refactor more systematically: First I change whatever
lines I planned to simplify, then I let <code>pylint</code> confirm that I can
get rid of the variables I'd planned to eliminate. It turns out I had
four unused variables in 430 lines of code, all easy to fix.</p>
<p>Another convention I wasn't following in 2012 is the use of
docstrings. Instead, I was writing big block comments, like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">################################################################################</span>
<span class="c1"># Procedure: validate_scrape</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Input: Parser and options objects from optparse</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Output: A list of well-formed name tuples.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Effects: Checks the options object to confirm the inputs are well formed.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">################################################################################</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that I work with jupyter and ipython more often, I have a better
appreciation for docstrings. It's really helpful to be able to do
<code>function_i_dont_remember ?</code> at a REPL and immediately pull up
documentation without context switching.</p>
<h2>Phase 2: Cleaning up the output.</h2>
<p>After fixing documentation, the next issue I wanted to improve was the
script's lack of logging. For some reason, I'd thought it would be a
good idea to send everything directly to <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code>. I even
added a <code>verbose</code> command line flag, and then introduced conditionals
in my code, like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">OPTIONS</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">verbose_on</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Searching MGP for </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">, </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">last</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">first</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">middle</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To simplify this, I introduced the <code>logging</code> package with a simple
configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">basicConfig</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">level</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">INFO</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="nb">format</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="si">%(asctime)s</span><span class="s1"> </span><span class="si">%(message)s</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="n">datefmt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'%m/</span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s1">/%Y %I:%M:%S %p'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>which let me write logs at several different levels whose visibility
can be adjusted in the configuration.</p>
<h2>Phase 3: Fixing bugs.</h2>
<p>At this point, I'd resolved most of the obvious issues I wanted to
fix, and narrowed down <code>pylint</code>'s suggestions to four issues, two of
which were TODOs I'd notice while addressing other issues:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">*************</span> <span class="n">Module</span> <span class="n">mgptree</span>
<span class="n">W</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">58</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">TODO</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Refactor</span> <span class="k">options</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">either</span> <span class="n">completely</span> <span class="k">global</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="k">not</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fixme</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">--------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="n">Your</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">been</span> <span class="n">rated</span> <span class="k">at</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">77</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">10</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Fixing the whitespace/formatting issues turned out to be a good way to
re-familiarize myself with the code before attempting to fix the
functional issues.</p>
<p>After running <code>mgptree</code> on a couple simple examples and looking at the
logs, I realized that the main functional issue was in the function
<code>fetch_id_num</code>. This function is supposed to take a tuple of names
(first, middle, and last) and determine the ID number of the
mathematician with that name in the MGP service (if the lookup fails
or returns multiple answers, we return <code>None</code>). The function is
supposed to do this by using <code>requests</code> to make a POST to the URL
associated with the PHP script that handles users' searches on the MGP
site, and then scraping the resulting reply.</p>
<p>Looking at the MGP website, it didn't appear to be very different from
what I remembered seeing in 2012, so I was puzzled why my scraping
code had stopped working. After running my function a few times in an
<code>ipython</code> shell, I realized my main error was my URL. Like a lot of
websites, the math genealogy has moved to HTTPS since 2012. Fixing
that and one other formatting change in the pages' <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> section
and my scraping code was working properly again.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Overall, the improvements I made to my script were pretty trivial,
but they illustrate some practices that I think are really helpful for
increasing one's personal productivity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Restoring an Invariant</em>: When I don't know what to do next (or
   where to start), I find <code>pylint</code> and <code>nosetests</code> are great
   guides. Both tools specify an invariant (no lint errors above a
   certain level, all unit tests passing, etc.) that should be
   maintained whenever code gets committed. If the invariant isn't
   satisfied, the next steps are clear: Investigate why, and fix it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One Thing a Time:</em> Even though my changes were simple, I made a
   total of 8 commits to get my code back in working order. Each one
   focusses on a single issue I wanted to improve in the code
   (i.e. remove all whitespace lint errors). I find it can be really
   easy to start "improving" two or three issues at the same time, and
   then do a poor job on all of them (or get stuck). For me, following
   the rule of one issue per commit has been a great way to stay
   organized and break larger problems into manageable pieces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I can see a couple of areas I might want to improve in the future. It
would be nice to to store scraped data in an <code>sqlite</code> database, which
might simplify computing other graph-based presentations of the
dataset (for example, finding all of the students descended from a
particular mathematician). It might also be cool to convert this to a
django or flask app, so that people unfamiliar with the command line
can generate their own graphs.</p>

                <p>The
<a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">Mathematics Geneaology Project</a>
(MGP) is a publicly searchable database that records advisor-advisee
relations between mathematicians. Their website is interesting,
particularly if you're interested in the history of
mathematics. Unfortunately, their website is also mostly text-based;
there isn't a way to visualize the relationships between large groups
of people.</p>
<p>I've created a tool that produces a directed graph displaying the
advisor-advisee relations stored in the MGP database. I created this
tool in 2012 in order to learn about how to process data from the web
using python.</p>

<p>After reading the steps below, you should be able to produce a picture
like the one below.</p>
<p><img alt="A genealogical tree" src="https://jsthomas.github.io/images/mgptree/gauss.png" style="width: 764px; height: auto;"/></p>
<p>Naturally, the real purpose of the tool is to make much bigger graphs
than this!</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>You will need the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A copy of my python script which you can <a href="https://github.com/jsthomas/mgptree">download here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An installation of <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> (this
program takes care of the actual graph drawing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of the command line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On an Ubuntu machine, these dependencies (<code>graphviz</code> and <code>requests</code>)
can be installed via:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo apt install virtualenv graphviz
$ virtualenv venv
$ venv/bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> $ pip install requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Usage Example</h2>
<p>The easiest way to learn how to use this tool is by way of an
example. Place the <code>mgptree</code> script in a convenient folder (the
program generates a number of files). Change the permissions on the
script so that you can execute it.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to generate a tree for Gauß and Fourier, going back
5 generations. The first step is to prepare a file of names for our
search:</p>
<p>So, we create a unicode text file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Gauß, Carl, Friedrich</span>
<span class="err">Fourier, Jean-Baptiste, Joseph</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'll call the file <code>gf.txt</code>. Now we need to get some data from the
web. We do this as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">(venv) $ python mgptree.py -g 5 -s -i gf.txt -o gf.mgp</span>
<span class="err">Saved 25 records to file gf.mgp.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-s</code> option indicates we want to "scrape" data from the MGP
website. The <code>-g</code> option indicates how many generations backward we
want to search. The <code>-i</code> denotes our input file, the <code>-o gf.mgp</code>
indicates that we want to save our results in a database named
<code>gf.mgp</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to graph the data, so we type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">(venv) $ python mgptree.py -p -i gf.mgp -o gf.dot</span>
<span class="err">(venv) $ dot -Tpng gf.dot -o gf.png</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the first line, the <code>-p</code> indicates we are now in "plotting mode"
where we want to convert the input database <code>gf.mgp</code> to a textual
format, which we'll save as <code>gf.dot</code>. The next line hands the textual
data to the graphviz program <code>dot</code>, which converts it to a PNG image
file named <code>gf.png</code>. (Many other file formats are available.)</p>
<p><img alt="Genealogical trees of Gauss and Fourier" src="https://jsthomas.github.io/images/mgptree/gf.png" style="width: 1915px; height: auto;"/></p>
<p>Creating the intermediate database <code>gf.mgp</code> allows us to work with the
data offline, without having to query the web while we are figuring
out how we want to plot the data.  For example, suppose we only want
to present two generations of the data we just downloaded. Then we'd
type</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">(venv) $ python mgptree.py -p -g2 -i gf.mgp -o gf_tiny.dot</span>
<span class="err">(venv) $ dot -Tpng gf_tiny.dot -o gf_tiny.png</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we wouldn't have to retrieve any information from the web. The
result, <code>gf_tiny.png</code> looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A small genealogical tree of Gauss and Fourier." src="https://jsthomas.github.io/images/mgptree/gf_tiny.png" style="width: 907px; height: auto;"/></p>
<p>This feature can be pretty useful if you're trying to work with very
large sets of data and don't know how much information you want to
present.</p>
<h2>Usage Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Math Geneaology Project has some "holes" in its data. This seems
to be particularly true for mathematicians who didn't get their degree
in Europe or the US. If you or your advisor aren't listed, add your
data to their website
<a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/submit.php">here</a> to help fill
in the gaps!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of requests to the MGP's database can grow to be quite
large if you search back 10 or more generations. In particular, it's
probably not a good idea to try to generate a tree for a large number
of people <em>and</em> many generations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accurately matching name data isn't easy. For example, the
mathematician Felix Klein is really named Christian Felix Klein. If
your searches don't succeed, check to make sure you've got your name
data right. This is particularly true for names with accents and
umlauts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Making Pretty Graphs</h2>
<p>Because my script produces an intermediate <code>.dot</code> file, it is possible
for you to edit that file to add additional information or decorations
to the graph. Don't like the font I chose? Change the <code>font=Courier</code>
entry in the <code>.dot</code> file. Want to adjust a few nodes so that
significant mathematicians have special node colors? Search for their
names in the <code>.dot</code> file, then add the metadata
<code>color=[your color here]</code> to their nodes. The documentation for
graphviz is very useful for tasks like this.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>In the Fall of 2013, I developed a camera-based keyboard system as my
term project for an image analysis course. This page provides a brief
summary of my project.</p>
<p>In my system, a webcam looks down on a user's hands, which rest on a
paper keyboard template. My program collects images from the webcam to
determine when and where the user touches the keyboard template. When
the user touches a key, my program produces the corresponding letter
as output.</p>
<p>Virtual keyboards are still actively researched in computer science
and electrical engineering. The system I implemented uses techniques
published in [1]-[3] between 2010 and 2013. Camera-based virtual
keyboards require a number of interesting image analysis techniques to
implement. They are particularly of interest in mobile applications
and in areas where one would like to avoid the cost of a physical
keyboard (for example, projects providing computers to people in the
developing world).</p>
<h1>Processing Steps</h1>
<p>The virtual keyboard system I implemented needed to solve three main
problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Detect the locations of the user's fingertips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect whether any fingertips are in contact with the tabletop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a fingertip touches the tabletop, determine which key was
pressed on the keyboard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first problem can be solved by segmenting an input image <span class="math">\(I\)</span> into
two regions: one representing the hands and another representing the
background. For each connected component of the hand region, we can
extract a contour <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> that traverses the boundary
counterclockwise. Places where <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> has high curvature (the
places where <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> bends the most sharply) typically correspond to
fingertips.</p>
<p><img alt="Virtual keyboard processing steps." src="https://jsthomas.github.io/images/vkeyboard/kb_processing.png" style="width: 1680px; height: auto;"/></p>
<p>I addressed the second problem using a technique called <em>shadow
analysis</em>, which is discussed in [1]. With this technique, we perform
another segmentation on <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, to locate the regions in the image that
represent the shadows of the user's hands. Then, we examine small
neighborhoods near the user's fingertips. If the proportion of
shadow-pixels in a given neighborhood is above a certain threshold, we
infer that the corresponding fingertip is not in contact with the
tabletop (because it has a shadow). Otherwise, we declare that
fingertip to be touching the keyboard.</p>
<p>The last problem is solved by making some assumptions about the
geometry of the keyboard and imaging system. I assumed that the
keyboard template displays four easily identifiable control points
arranged in a rectangle, and that the front edge of the control
rectangle is parallel to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis of the camera's coordinate
system. With these additional assumptions, it isn't too hard to invert
the perspective projection and recover the keyboard-space coordinates
of each keypress from the image-space coordinates of the fingertips.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>After implementing my virtual keyboard system in python, I analyzed
its performance under different lighting and usage conditions. My
tests suggest that a camera-based user interface that uses shadow
analysis will work best under conditions where one has fine control
over the lighting conditions and the user does not need to enter very
much data at one time. For example, a camera-based user interface
would work well in an interactive museum exhibit, but it might not be
a very good tool for word processing in a dark coffee shop. Currently,
camera-based keyboards cannot provide the speed and accuracy
achievable on physical keyboards (but for that matter, neither do
touchscreen keyboards).</p>
<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>Below are links to the paper and code I wrote for the term project. I
used the code within <a href="http://ipython.org/">ipython</a> to conduct my
experiments, and used the <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> project to get
data from the camera. OpenCV's support for python is still under
development, so if you examine my code you may have to adapt it to
work with your particular hardware and copy of OpenCV.</p>
