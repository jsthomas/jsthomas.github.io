This blog consists of articles about new things I learned and topics
I'm excited about. It documents some of the projects I worked on in
the past (and some of my efforts to refactor them) and my current
understanding of "good techniques".

I studied mathematics and computer science at the University of
Arizona, in Tucson. Currently I live in Boston, Massachusetts, where I
work as a software developer for a telecommunications company. I'm
interested in programming languages, functional programming, data
science, and mathematics.
