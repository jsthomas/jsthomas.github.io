Hello! This blog consists of articles about new things I've learned
and topics I'm excited about.

I studied mathematics and computer science at the University of
Arizona, in Tucson. Currently I live in Boston, Massachusetts, where I
work as a software developer for a telecommunications company. I'm
interested in programming languages, functional programming, data
science, and mathematics.
