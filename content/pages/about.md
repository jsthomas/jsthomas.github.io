Hello! This blog consists of articles about new things I've learned
and topics I'm excited about.

I studied mathematics and computer science at the University of
Arizona.  Currently I live in Colorado, where I work as a software
developer. My PhD work was in discrete differential geometry. Most of
my professional work has focused on helping machine learning
applications succeed in cloud computing environments. I'm interested
in programming languages, data science, and mathematics.

Currently, I'm attending the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I'm making open source
contributions to the OCaml ecosystem.
