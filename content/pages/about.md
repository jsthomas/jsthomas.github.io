Hello! This blog consists of articles about new things I've learned
and topics I'm excited about.

I studied mathematics and computer science at the University of
Arizona, in Tucson. Currently I live in Colorado, where I work as a
software developer. I'm interested in programming languages,
functional programming, data science, and mathematics.
