Hello! This blog consists of articles about new things I've learned
and topics I'm excited about.

I studied mathematics and computer science at the University of Arizona.
Currently I live in Colorado, where I work as a software developer. My
professional work has focussed on helping machine learning applications succeed
in cloud computing environments. I'm interested in programming languages,
functional programming, data science, and mathematics.
