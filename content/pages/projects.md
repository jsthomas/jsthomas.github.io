* [Geometry in Context](http://geometry-in-context.github.io/) (Fall
  2014-Spring 2015) : I developed a series of animated videos to teach
  concepts in Euclidean geometry.

* [A Camera-Based Virtual Keyboard
  System]({filename}../vkeyboard.md) (Fall 2013) : I built a system that uses a
  camera (and image analysis techniques) to turn video input of a
  user's hands into keyboard input. This project used Python and
  OpenCV.

* [A Mathematics Geneaology Project
  Visualizer]({filename}../mgptree.md) (Fall 2012) : I used Python,
  `requests`, and `dot` to make a command line tool that makes "family
  trees" based on data in the Mathematics Genealogy project.
