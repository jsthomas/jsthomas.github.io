Here is a selection of public projects I've worked on over the years.

# Open Source

* [tidy_email](https://github.com/jsthomas/tidy_email) : An OCaml
  library that makes it easy to send email with Mailgun, Sendgrid, and
  SMTP.

# Papers

* (With David Glickenstein) : [Duality structures and discrete conformal variations of piecewise constant curvature surfaces](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870816314682) : Advances in Mathematics, Volume 320, 7 November 2017.

* [Conformal Variations of Piecewise Constant Curvature Two and Three Dimensional Manifolds]({static}/docs/geometry/dissertation.pdf) (Spring 2015) : My PhD dissertation.

* [Source Unfolding Convex Polytopes]({static}/docs/geometry/unfolding.pdf) (Spring 2013) : My comprehensive exam paper.

* [A Camera Based Virtual Keyboard with Touch Detection by Shadow Analysis]({static}/docs/vkeyboard/vkeyboard.pdf)
  (Fall, 2013) : A term paper I wrote about my efforts to build a
  camera based user interface.

# Talks

* [Why Python?]({static}/docs/talks/whypython.pdf) (November 2012) :
  Thoughts on Python as a tool for mathematical research.

* [Source Unfolding]({static}/docs/talks/unfolding.pdf) (April 2012)
          : My comprehensive-exam slides on source unfolding.

* [Compilers and Automata]({static}/docs/talks/compilers.pdf)
  (November 2011) : This talk gave an overview of how compilers work
  (to an audience of mathematicians).

# Projects

* [Geometry in Context](http://geometry-in-context.github.io/) (Fall
  2014-Spring 2015) : I developed a series of animated videos to teach
  concepts in Euclidean geometry.

* [A Camera-Based Virtual Keyboard
  System]({filename}../vkeyboard.md) (Fall 2013) : I built a system that uses a
  camera (and image analysis techniques) to turn video input of a
  user's hands into keyboard input. This project used Python and
  OpenCV.

* [A Mathematics Geneaology Project
  Visualizer]({filename}../mgptree.md) (Fall 2012) : I used Python,
  `requests`, and `dot` to make a command line tool that makes "family
  trees" based on data in the Mathematics Genealogy project.
